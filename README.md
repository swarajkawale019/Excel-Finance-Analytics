Financial Analytics Report for AtliQ Hardwares (FY2019-FY2021)
1. **Project Overview**

This repository provides a comprehensive financial analysis of AtliQ Hardwares, a company specializing in hardware solutions. The project's primary goal is to deliver actionable insights into the company's performance by examining its profit and loss (P&L) statements from fiscal year 2019 to 2021.

The analysis delves into key financial metrics such as Net Sales, Cost of Goods Sold (COGS), and Gross Margin to evaluate growth, profitability, and market-specific performance. These reports serve as a vital tool for stakeholders to understand historical trends, identify areas of strength and weakness, and make data-driven decisions for future strategy.

2.2. P&L by Months

3. **Key Insights from the Analysis**
   
3.1. Strong Revenue Growth

• The company has demonstrated exceptional growth, with Net Sales skyrocketing from $87.5M in FY2019 to $196.7M in FY2020, and reaching $598.9M in FY2021. This represents a growth of over 204% between FY2020 and FY2021 alone.

3.2. Evolving Profitability

• While the absolute Gross Margin has increased significantly (from $36.2M in 2019 to $218.2M in 2021), the overall Gross Margin Percentage (GM %) has experienced a slight contraction, moving from 41.4% in FY2019 to 36.4% in FY2021. This suggests that the cost of goods sold has grown at a slightly faster rate than sales revenue.

3.3. Market-Specific Performance (FY2021)

• India stands out as the largest market by a significant margin, contributing $161.3M in Net Sales.

• The USA and the United Kingdom are also major markets, with Net Sales of $87.8M and $34.2M, respectively.

• Profitability varies across markets. For instance, New Zealand shows a high GM % of 48.2%, while Germany has a lower GM % of 26.2%, indicating different pricing strategies or cost structures.

3.4. Regional Profitability Trends

• The quarterly GM % report reveals fluctuating profitability across sub-zones. For example, the NA (North America) sub-zone's GM % improved from ~35% in FY2019 to ~40% in FY2020, before settling around 37% in FY2021. Such trends are critical for regional management to investigate.

**Outcomes**

• Delivered multi-dimensional financial insights (time, region, market).

• Highlighted profitability drivers and margin challenges.
